Fire-o-Works
============

This is a short, simulation game created by using JQuery. Unleash the fireworks! (COMPLETE)


*Note*

Hi, all!

The game is finally finished! I managed to pull off this short, repeating-firework mayhem. I want to give thanks to everyone who tried it - gave their opinion - and lended me some tips! :) 

Although it is *finished*, I **still** want to update this game so that it can have greater abilities. So, if you're willing to join me, just shoot me an email (yazidnoned@hotmail) and I'll get you started! Once you're in, you can fork the repo and lash out your inner-coding fury if you have some ideas. *If you don't*, don't worry! I have plenty of little ideas below that came from reviewers, programmers and etc. Feel free to email me yours to be seen!

Happy coding!

1. The game should have a **Start Menu**, with a button that *plays the game* as well as link *to your other ones*. Or, it could possibly **link to your website** that has these games on it. (Good one!)
2. The game should have sound implemented, activating after each firework. (*almost finished*)
3. It should be viewed better on mobile. 
4. After a certain amount of times (of the user re-doing the fireworks), a button should appear to another level with different fireworks. (Like this idea)
